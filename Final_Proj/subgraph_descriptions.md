These subgraphs are different ways to filter the **Largest Connected Component (LCC)** of the Panama Papers network ($\approx 942,000$ nodes) to create smaller, more focused networks for analysis.

| Subgraph | Construction Method | Significance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`ego_3hop`** | Built by taking all nodes and edges within **3 steps (hops)** of any **Power Player** (a key individual of interest). | This network **retains 100% of the Power Players** ($\mathbf{62/62}$) while reducing the total size to $\approx \mathbf{76,610}$ nodes. It is highly significant for **micro-level analysis** of the full, immediate, and extended operational environment surrounding the key figures. |
| **`betweenness_top10`** | Created by selecting the $\mathbf{10\%}$ of nodes with the highest **Betweenness Centrality**. This is done by selecting the nodes above the $90^{th}$ percentile of the centrality score. | It identifies the **most critical bridge nodes** or **bottlenecks** in the network, focusing on actors who lie on the most paths between other pairs of nodes. This highlights key control points for information or financial flows. |
| **`kcore_3`** | Constructed using **$k$-core decomposition** where $k=3$. This method iteratively removes nodes with a degree less than 3 until all remaining nodes have at least three neighbors within the induced subgraph. | This extracts a **dense, structurally robust core** of the network, comprising $\approx \mathbf{107,319}$ nodes. It is significant for filtering out sparse, irrelevant connections and focusing on actors involved in a persistent, minimal level of organizational structure. |
